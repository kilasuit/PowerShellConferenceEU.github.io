		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the next great European PowerShell event!</p>

		<p>Deutsche PowerShell Konferenz and enthusiastic PowerShell Community Members from all across Europe have united together 
		under the #PSConfEU banner to create an extraordinary PowerShell Community Event in Europe this coming April.</p>
		<p>For this conference we will be bringing together PowerShell experts from all around the globe to create a unique 3-day 
		event with presentations, workshops and the chance to connect, learn and discuss all things PowerShell with those that have 
		a real passion for this evolving technology. There will be no place like this to deep-dive PowerShell in all of its flavors 
		and colors.</p>

		<p>The conference languages are English and German. There are continuous main tracks in both languages, making sure you can 
		follow the tracks in the language you feel most comfortable with.</p>

		<p>After the announcement by <a href="http://powershell.org" target="_blank">PowerShell.Org</a> that the EU Summit would no longer 
		be organised by them, due to the reasons listed in this 
        <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/2015/09/13/future-of-powershell-summit-in-europe-and-north-america/" target="_blank"> 
		blog post</a>, there was an immediate decison to be made regarding the future of such an event in Europe.</p>
		
        <p>After some careful consideration by members of the European PowerShell Community, we decided on using the 
		#PSConfEU banner. This was in part done with a wish to align with the <a href="http://www.powershell.asia" target="_blank">Asian 
		PowerShell Conference</a> (#PSConfAsia), and we are delighted to announce that the organizing teams from both conferences 
		are positive about working together in the future.</p>

         <p>We as organisers of this event would like to thank the <a href="http://powershell.org" target="_blank">PowerShell.Org</a> 
		team for the work that they have done in the past with the events already held, and we will be working closely with them and 
		the <a href="http://www.powershell.asia" target="_blank">Asia PowerShell Conference Team</a> to ensure that events do not overlap 
		in the upcoming years. After all, this is an effort BY the community, FOR the community - one that the whole organising team 
		are very much committed to.</p>

        <h4>Further Background</h4>
		<p>2016 is Leibniz Year in Hannover. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" target="_blank">Leibniz</a> 
		researched more than 300 years ago, and some of his concepts like the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology" target="_blank">Monadology</a> are spiritual roots of PowerShell. 
		It is easy to get to Hannover by railway or plane, and we secured hotel contingents that you can optionally take advantage of 
		when you register.</p>
		
		<p>Conference seats are strictly limited to 160 attendees on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p>
