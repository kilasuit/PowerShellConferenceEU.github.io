# PowerShellConferenceEU.github.io
This is the website for PowerShell Conference Europe. We are maintaining parallel English and German versions of the site, as this is a completely bilingual conference.

Jekyll is the engine, chosen primarily because it's standard for GitHub. Simplicity with bilingual support from the beginning is our focus.

Next steps:

1) Add content :)
2) Integrate a template to make it easier to add a spiffy design
